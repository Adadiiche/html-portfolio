<h1>The Best Movies According to Vivian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>An amazing Sci-Fi movie by marvel. Absolutely fantastic. Great cast and well selected scene.</p>
<h3>Three Thousand Years of Longing</h3>
<p>There are several movie stories about genie and their kinds but this was different and my all time favourite. It had a beautiful soundtrack and really played with my emotions.</p>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>It is an animated musical by Disney about a large family blessed with magical gifts. It was really artistic and detailed.</p>
